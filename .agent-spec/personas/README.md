# The Persona System

> **Goal: Artificial Constraints generate higher quality output.**

By default, an AI model acts as a "helpful assistant" trying to please the user. If the user asks for a feature quickly, the default AI will write tightly-coupled, untested code to get it done fast.

In `agent-spec`, we force the AI to adopt specific personas. Each persona has a strict set of rules it must follow, even if it frustrates the human user.

---

## How to Use Personas

To activate a persona, the user types the trigger phrase into the chat:
`Activate: @ARCHITECT`

The agent must immediately:
1. Load the corresponding persona file (e.g., `personas/ARCHITECT.md`).
2. Acknowledge the activation.
3. Apply the persona's rules to all subsequent outputs until a different persona is activated.

## Available Personas

| Persona | Trigger | Primary Goal |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Architect** | `@ARCHITECT` | System design, SOLID principles, preventing technical debt. |
| **AI Architect** | `@AI-ARCHITECT` | Agentic design: skill vs hook vs subagent vs script, prompt cost. |
| **Security Auditor** | `@SECURITY` | Enforcing safe data handling, authentication, and authorization. |
| **QA Engineer** | `@QA` | Writing test cases, edge case discovery, TDD enforcement. |
| **Code Reviewer** | `@REVIEWER` | (Default) Skeptical review of code, syntax, and style. |
| **Tech Writer** | `@WRITER` | Documentation, PRDs, ADRs, and clear communication. |
| **Refactor Specialist** | `@REFACTOR` | Cleaning up legacy code without changing behavior. |
| **API Designer** | `@API` | REST/GraphQL contract design, versioning, and payloads. |
| **Data Engineer** | `@DATA` | Database schema design, migrations, and query optimization. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | `@DEVOPS` | Docker, CI/CD, deployment scripts, and configuration. |
| **Performance Engineer**| `@PERF` | Memory leaks, slow queries, algorithmic efficiency. |

## The Default Persona
If no persona is explicitly activated, the agent defaults to **@REVIEWER**.
